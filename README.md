This solution consists of three projects
- CompaniesClient - a windows application, which connects to 
- CompanyRestService - an ASP.NET Web APi which allows for CRUD against a list of companies, which uses
- DataAccessLayer - an abstraction for the persistence layer for the web API. Currently the web api uses an in memory storage.
